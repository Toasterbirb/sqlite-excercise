# sqlite-excercise
Some school thingie to learn SQL

Database file (data.sqlite) is included in the repo. Modifying person data isn't working currently. It has some issues with input reading causing some weird output to the database. I'm aware of this.

## Compiling
Run `make` in the root directory. GCC is used as a compiler but this can be changed in the Makefile.
